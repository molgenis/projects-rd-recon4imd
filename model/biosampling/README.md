## Biosampling

The purpose of the biosampling model is to reproduce the biosampling SOP as an EMX2 schema; specifically, the capture of specimen collection and shipment. End users will be allowed to register new patients and to submit new samples into IMDhub, as well as to link patients with one or more samples.
